# Workouts
this projects contains to display sequence of fibonacci series.
-> Fibonacci.py file act as a library which contains a method FibonacciSeries(parm) with one parameter.
-> Need to pass some integer value in parameter
-> it will return febonacci sequence where it get called
-> TestFibonacci.py is the class which is used to call fibonacci class to display output.
-> try to run TestFibonacci.py at very first
-> change the value in the statement " st=obj.FibonacciSeries(8)" in TestFibonacci.py


Technique used:

1. one method to return fibonacci series which will be resuable to any class
2. using list to append sum of two integers
3. using join and map to return list values as comma separated string
4. added condition to check allow positive integer, tyr catch to throw error
